      "I want people seeking abortion care to know that they are supported and loved by a community larger than they could ever imagine.
         Millions of people across this country have had abortions—people of different genders, people of different sexual orientations, different  
         races, different ethnic backgrounds, different religions.
        There’s a community that is there for you and supports your right to choose.”

         <p> _________________________________________________<p> </p><br><br>
       <p> Abortion is legal, but access doesn’t look the same for everyone. 
        In fact, it can often vary depending on your age, where you live, or how much money you have. 
        Luckily, there are organizations that make navigating reliable information and resources a lot easier, 
        which is helpful since misinformation and negative messaging are often spread by anti-abortion activists. 
        If you think you’re pregnant or know you want an abortion, here’s what you should do below. </p>

            If you think you might be pregnant, taking a pregnancy test is a helpful first step. 
            You can purchase pregnancy tests from your local pharmacy, grocery store, or dollar store 
            — pregnancy tests from the dollar store work just as well as more expensive tests!
             Your local health department or abortion clinic might also offer free pregnancy testing. 
             Be careful though—some clinics offering free tests are actually anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers.

            When you’re pregnant, you can do one of two things: continue the pregnancy or not. 
            If you choose to continue the pregnancy, you have two options: parenting or seeking adoption. 
            If you choose to not continue the pregnancy, then your option is abortion. 
            <br> 
            <br> 
            If you’re not sure about what you’d like to do and want to discuss your options with an unbiased, 
            supportive person, you can contact All-Options, an organization that provides emotional support to people
             in all pregnancy outcomes or you can speak with a counselor at an abortion clinic. They’ll all support you no matter what.

            Once you’ve confirmed your pregnancy, and if you’ve made the decision to have an abortion, 
            you can locate your closest abortion clinic via <a href="https://www.ineedana.com/" ><u>INeedAnA.com</u>.</a>
        <br>
        <br>

            Wherever you decide to go, make sure they actually confirm on the phone or on their website 
            that they actually provide abortions—some anti-abortion clinics pretend they do just to get 
            you to waste time and go to their clinic to hear their misinformation. Unfortunately, because 
            of anti-abortion restrictions, your nearest clinic might be in another state or across your state. 
         <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Don’t be discouraged.</strong>

      <br>
      <p style="border-width:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#563e3677; padding: 2em;">
        The cost of an abortion can range from $200 to over $15,000 depending on how far along you are
         in your pregnancy, the method, and where you live, and how far you have to travel. 
         You can expect to pay an average of $500 for your procedure if you’re within the first trimester, 
         plus whatever travel costs you incur to get to the clinic.
    <br>
    <br>
        Because of anti-abortion restrictions and stigma, not everyone can use their health insurance 
        to pay for their abortions. If you have private or state insurance, you may be able to use it 
        for some or all of the costs depending on where you live.

      <p>
        <p style="border-width:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#563e3677; padding: 2em;">
        Check your insurance policy to see if it covers ‘outpatient pregnancy termination’ or some similar language. 
        A federal policy called the Hyde Amendment currently bans health insurance programs like Medicaid or other states’ 
        public health insurance programs from covering abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. 
        Some of these cases require you to file a police report or other paperwork. In <u></u>some states, 
        their state Medicaid insurance pays for abortions</u>. Ask the clinic when you make your appointment and they can help you.

      <p>
       <p style="border-width:7px; border-style:solid; border-color:#563e3677; padding: 2em;">
        If you can’t afford your procedure or don’t live close to an abortion clinic, there are organizations that can help you. 
        Your local abortion fund—an organization that helps people pay for a portion of their abortions and get to the clinic—can assist.
        You can also ask your clinic to screen you for financial assistance, offer a discount, or call the National Abortion Federation for help.
        <br>
        <br>
        Abortion should an accessible, affordable, and supportive experience for everyone, but because it’s not, these organizations 
        try to bridge the gap between what you have and what you need.
